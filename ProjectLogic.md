  Data Storage Architecture

  Firebase Firestore (Cloud Database)

  All core data is stored in Firebase Firestore, NOT local SQLite. Here's the database structure:

  // Firestore Collections Structure

  // Users Collection
  users/
  ├── {userId}/
      ├── profile data (name, phone, email, userType)
      ├── location data
      ├── priest-specific data (if priest)
      └── devotee preferences (if devotee)

  // Services Collection
  services/
  ├── {serviceId}/
      ├── priestId
      ├── service details
      ├── pricing info
      └── cancellation policy

  // Bookings Collection
  bookings/
  ├── {bookingId}/
      ├── devoteeId
      ├── priestId
      ├── service details
      ├── scheduling info
      ├── payment data
      └── status

  // Reviews Collection
  reviews/
  ├── {reviewId}/
      ├── bookingId
      ├── priestId
      ├── devoteeId
      ├── rating
      └── comment

  // Availability Collection
  availability/
  ├── {priestId}/
      └── {date}/
          └── timeSlots[]

  // Payments Collection (sensitive data)
  payments/
  ├── {paymentId}/
      ├── bookingId
      ├── stripePaymentIntentId
      ├── amounts
      └── status

  Data Storage Implementation

  Looking at src/services/firestore.ts, the app uses Firebase Firestore for all data operations:

  // Example from firestore.ts
  export const createUser = async (userId: string, userData: Partial<User>) => {
    const userRef = doc(db, 'users', userId);
    await setDoc(userRef, {
      ...userData,
      createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
      updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
    });
  };

  export const getBookings = async (userId: string, userType: 'priest' | 'devotee') => {
    const field = userType === 'priest' ? 'priestId' : 'devoteeId';
    const q = query(
      collection(db, 'bookings'),
      where(field, '==', userId),
      orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
    );
    // ... returns booking data
  };

  Local Storage Usage

  The app uses minimal local storage:

  1. AsyncStorage (React Native) for:
    - Authentication tokens
    - User preferences
    - Cached user profile
    - AI response cache (to reduce API costs)
  2. Context State for runtime data:
    - Current user session
    - Active booking flow
    - UI state

  Data Sync Strategy

  1. Real-time Updates: Firestore listeners for bookings, messages
  2. Offline Support: Firestore's built-in offline persistence
  3. Optimistic Updates: Update UI immediately, sync to Firebase
  4. Background Sync: Push notifications trigger data refresh

  Security Rules

  Firebase Firestore security rules ensure:
  - Users can only read/write their own data
  - Priests can only modify their own services
  - Bookings are accessible to both parties
  - Payment data has restricted access

  No database creation needed - Firebase Firestore is automatically provisioned when you set up the Firebase project. The collections are created automatically when data is first written to them.

! DEPRECATION NOTICE: Action required to deploy after Dec 31, 2025

  functions.config() API is deprecated.
  Cloud Runtime Configuration API, the Google Cloud service used to store function configuration data, will be shut down on December 31, 2025. As a result, you must migrate away from using functions.config() to continue deploying your functions after December 31, 2025.

  What this means for you:

  - The Firebase CLI commands for managing this configuration (functions:config:set, get, unset, clone, and export) are deprecated. These commands no longer work after December 31, 2025.
  - firebase deploy command will fail for functions that use the legacy functions.config() API after December 31, 2025.

  Existing deployments will continue to work with their current configuration.
