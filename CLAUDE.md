## Technical Details

### File Structure Requirements
- Maximum 300 lines per file (adjusted from 250)
- No deprecated features
- Complete, production-ready code
- Modern React Native patterns

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Dynamic Service Management** - Priests can create custom services (not hardcoded)
2. **Flexible Pricing** - Fixed, range-based, or quote-on-request
3. **Complex Payment Flows** - Escrow, multi-party payouts, loyalty credits
4. **Location-Based Matching** - ZIP code radius search
5. **Three Priest Types** - Temple Employee, Temple Owner, Independent

### Architecture Decisions
- Using React Context + useReducer for state management
- Firebase for backend services
- Stripe Connect for payment processing
- TypeScript for type safety
- Utility-first styling approach

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Files Count: 36 files
- Configuration: 4 files
- Types: 5 files  
- Utilities: 5 files
- Contexts: 3 files
- Services: 6 files
- Navigation: 4 files
- Common Components: 9 files

### Architecture Highlights
1. **Authentication System**: Phone-based auth with OTP verification
2. **State Management**: Context + Reducer pattern for complex state
3. **Payment Architecture**: 
   - Stripe Connect for priest payouts
   - Escrow system for advance payments
   - Multi-party payment splits (priest, temple, platform)
   - Loyalty credit retention system
4. **Real-time Features**: Notifications, messaging, live booking updates
5. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with strict types

## Next Steps
Phase 4: Authentication Screens - Implement the authentication flow screens including Welcome, Phone Auth, OTP, User Type selection, and Profile Setup.
